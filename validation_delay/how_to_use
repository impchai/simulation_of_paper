The code shows the validation delay of the test gap, which compares the delay of both model training and model validation.
To use the code, there are three steps to enable the code:
1. Unzip the testset.zip to the current directory.
2. Download the trained model "local-1.wlnet" at https://www.kaggle.com/impchai/trainedmodel, and copy the model to the current directory.
3. Run gap_chydelay.nb.
