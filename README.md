# simulation_of_paper
This is the simulation of the paper entitled "Secure and Efficient Blockchain based Knowledge Sharing for Intelligent Connected Vehicles" that has been uploaded at https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01598.
The dataset of the simulation can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/impchai/mydata.
In addition, we also provide the well-trained model and training record at https://www.kaggle.com/impchai/trainedmodel.
In the simulation of ADL, we give the test vedio in Airsim platform that is trained by the model. The vedio can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/impchai/testvedio.

In simula_of_DAG, dc_ledger.py depicts Fig. 5 (a) in the paper, stability.py depicts Fig. 5 (b). The folder confirmation illustrates Fig. 6.
